      upstart configuration if required.
    - d/ubuntu|debian_control_vars,d/control,d/rules: Provide different Depends 
      for zookeeperd package when building under Ubuntu/Debian.
  * Enabled C and Java test suites:
    - d/control,d/compat: Bumped debhelper compat level to 8 to allow 
      arch/indep overrides.
    - d/rules: Enable test suites for -arch and -indep builds.
    - d/patches/debian/patch-build-system: Patch unit testing to exclude 
      InvalidSnapshot and Upgrade tests (non-free data) and to pickup 
      junit4 from system library.

zookeeper (3.3.3+dfsg2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated patch for ZOOKEEPER-1117 with fixes accepted into
    zookeeper 3.4.0 upstream; should also resolve FTBFS on ia64.
  * Close RFH from original maintainer (Closes: #602694).
  * debian/zookeeper.cron.daily: handle return code of 1 so daily cron job
    does not produce error emails when the package is removed but not
    purged (Closes: #582757). Thanks to Clint Byrum for this fix.

zookeeper (3.3.3+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  * Removed Thomas Koch from Uploaders - thanks for all of your work.
  * Bumped Standards-Version: 3.9.2; no changes.
  * Transition to dh_python2.
  * Fixed FTBFS due to -Werror actually working and causing build 
    failures in gcc >= 4.6.1 (Closes: #625441).
  * debian/bin/zkPurgeTxnLog.sh: Switch DATADIR and DATALOGDIR to match
    parameter ordering in Zookeeper code (Closes: #601383) - thanks to 
    Paul Paradise for identifying this issue and the fix.
